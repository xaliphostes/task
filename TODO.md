# Todo list
New classes that would be useful additions to this library:

- **TaskQueue** - A priority-based task scheduler that could accept tasks with different priorities and execute them accordingly, rather than just in parallel or sequential order.
- **TaskGroup** - A class that logically groups related tasks and manages their dependencies, allowing you to define task relationships like "run after" or "requires completion of."
- **RetryableTask** - A specialized task that automatically retries on failure with configurable backoff strategies, useful for network operations or other potentially transient failures.
- **CachedTask** - A task wrapper that caches the results of expensive operations and reuses them until invalidated, useful for computationally intensive operations.
- **PeriodicTask** - A task that automatically schedules itself to run at regular intervals, useful for polling operations or scheduled maintenance.
- **TaskObserver** - A specialized monitoring class that collects statistics about task execution across the system for reporting and visualization.
- **CompositeAlgorithm** - A class that combines multiple algorithms into a single workflow, with branching and conditional logic.
- **TaskFactory** - A factory class for creating task instances based on configuration or input data.
- **DistributedTask** - A task that could be executed across multiple processes or even machines, extending the library's capabilities beyond a single process.
- **TaskSerializer** - A utility for serializing task state and results to disk, allowing long-running tasks to be paused and resumed later.
- **TaskProfiler** - A specialized monitoring tool that tracks execution time, memory usage, and performance metrics for tasks.
- **AsyncResult** - A more sophisticated future/promise implementation specifically designed to work with the task library's signal system.

These additions would enhance the library with more advanced scheduling, monitoring, and composition capabilities while maintaining compatibility with the existing signal-slot architecture.
