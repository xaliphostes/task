This example demonstrates a comprehensive sensor data processing pipeline that leverages all the new features:

# Sensor Data Processing Pipeline
The example creates a robust pipeline for processing IoT sensor data that showcases the power of the enhanced task library:

## Key Components and Features Demonstrated

1. Directory Monitoring with PeriodicTask
   - The DataMonitor class watches for new sensor data files using the PeriodicTask functionality
   - Automatically detects and processes new files as they arrive

2. Fault-Tolerant Parsing with RetryableTask
    - The DataParser class parses sensor data files with automatic retry capabilities
    - Handles transient errors gracefully with configurable retry strategies

3. Smart Caching with CachedTask
    - The AnomalyDetector caches computation results to avoid redundant processing
    - Automatically invalidates cache after a configurable time period

4. Priority-Based Processing with TaskQueue
    - Files are processed based on priority in the task queue
    - Controls concurrency to prevent system overload

5. Logical Grouping with TaskGroup
    - Anomaly detection tasks are grouped together for collective management
    - Allows coordination of related tasks

6. Pipeline Orchestration with CompositeAlgorithm
    - The SensorDataPipeline class coordinates the entire workflow
    - Manages the lifecycle of all components

7. Performance Tracking with TaskProfiler
    - Measures execution time and resource usage of critical components
    - Provides performance insights for optimization

8. State Persistence with TaskSerializer
    - Saves pipeline state to disk periodically
    - Enables recovery after system shutdown or failure

9. Asynchronous Processing with AsyncResult
    - Uses enhanced futures for non-blocking coordination
    - Enables responsive system behavior



## Real-World Applications
This example demonstrates a system that could be used for:
- Industrial IoT Monitoring: Process sensor data from manufacturing equipment to detect anomalies and prevent failures
- Environmental Monitoring: Analyze data from weather stations or pollution sensors
- Building Management: Process HVAC, security, and occupancy sensor data for smart buildings
- Supply Chain Monitoring: Track temperature-sensitive goods with automatic alerts for threshold violations
- Scientific Data Processing: Process experimental data with robust error handling and caching

The pipeline handles the complete data lifecycle:
- Data ingestion (file monitoring)
- Parsing and validation (with automatic retries)
- Processing (anomaly detection with caching)
- Aggregation (statistical calculations)
- Reporting (output files)
